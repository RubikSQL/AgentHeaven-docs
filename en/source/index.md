> **Ask not what your agents can do for you, ask what you can do for your agents.**

AgentHeaven is **NOT** another agent framework; it's an approach to knowledge management designed for the era of AI.

The purpose of AgentHeaven is to provide everything **BEFORE** the agent acts, enabling agents to work in a friendly, context-rich environment, i.e., a "heaven" for agents.

It empowers you to build a agentic lifelong learning system for any data application, treating AI agents as capable human beings, and as our users.

## Key Features

- **📚 Knowledge Management**: Turn domain knowledge from docs, databases, and user queries into Unified Knowledge Format (UKF) and manage them efficiently and automatically.
- **🗄️ Databases Integration**: Highly-abstract integration with SQL databases (via [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)), vector databases (via [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)), and other storage & retrieval backends.
- **🦙 LLMs Integration**: Unified interface for various language models (via [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/)) with configurable presets and modular caching.
- **🚀 Imitation is All You Need**: An agent builder based on imitation that creates and continuously refines domain-specific agents through weak-supervision.
- **⚡ Agents For Agents**: Use agents to help improve agents, starting the exponential growth of agentic system development.
- **👤 Human-In-The-Loop**: Get involved in the agents' training process easily using natural language instructions.
- **🌏 Internationalization**: Using [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) + [Babel](https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/) for prompt management, with agentic translation and prompt creation features.
- **🛠 Utilities**: A comprehensive collection of Python helper functions to speed up the development process.
- **🖥 CLI & GUI Tools**: Command-line and graphical interfaces integrated, for both developers and low-code users.
- **🍀 MCP Compatible**: Centered around [FastMCP 2.0](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome/) to support various tool use and function call interfaces.
